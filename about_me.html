    <div class="about_me">
        <p>Hey there, I am Manvitha Siri Phani. Dedicated web designer and full-stack developer. I have basic knowledge of C, Java, and Python. I did a complete workshop on C by Skilltimate Technologies and developed an e-ticket movie booking application. I practiced DBMS using MySQL, Java and OOPS concepts in the college curriculum with hands-on experience.</p>

        <p>I did complete an intensive internship in Python by Path Creators. I worked with a team of 3, developed an automatic ID card generation application using Python and gained various skills like programming, time management and team coordination.</p>

        <p>Apart from technical skills, I have developed an ability to plan, organize, and consistently chase the goal. I am a believer in true skills, then true to wealth. I have tackled the art of balance in life and time management from various activities on the curriculum in college. I love reading books and learning languages. I am A1 level french learner.</p>
